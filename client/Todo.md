 -- Just transferred all Trips logic from Dashboard to Trips component

    Next: 
        Figure out how to click on a trip and pull up an event with all events in the trip
            (fetch request with a query that pulls up this info)
        Create an event component that shows all of the info for the event
        Create inputs with CRUD
            Dashboard:
                âœ… Get all trips (...limit up to 5)
                âœ… Get all trips (...limit up to 5)

                âœ… Create a new trip
                    - Make sure date formats align with DB
                    - Add checkbox for isPublic 
                    - Then it will be complete!

            Inside of Trips Component:
                âœ… Edit Trip Modal
                âœ… Delete Trip
                âœ… Update trip
                âœ… Delete trip

            Events Component:
            (For each individual trip -- be able to):
                âœ… Get all events
                âœ… Create a new event
                âœ… Update event
                âœ… Delete events
                
        Figure out logic for the TripHub
                âœ… Get all trips
                ðŸ˜¡ Click Trip and go to that users Event page for that trip


        Create front end

        

 query the event table
 SELECT event.*, trip.* from event LEFT Join trip on trip.id = event.trip_id WHERE trip_id = $1
