 -- Just transferred all Trips logic from Dashboard to Trips component

    Next: 
        Figure out how to click on a trip and pull up an event with all events in the trip
            (fetch request with a query that pulls up this info)
        Create an event component that shows all of the info for the event
        Create inputs with CRUD
            Dashboard:
                âœ… Get all trips (...limit up to 5)
                âœ… Get all trips (...limit up to 5)

                ðŸ˜¡ Create a new trip
                    - Make sure date formats align with DB
                    - Add checkbox for isPublic 
                    - Then it will be complete!

                    
            
            Inside of Trips Component:
                ðŸ˜¡ Edit Trip Modal
                ðŸ˜¡ Delete Trip

            Events Component:
            (For each individual trip -- be able to):
                ðŸ˜¡ Get all events
                ðŸ˜¡ Create a new event
                ðŸ˜¡ Update event
                ðŸ˜¡ Delete events
                
        Figure out logic for the TripHub
            (how can people view and download other people's trips but not delete or edit them?)
        
        Create front end
