 -- Just transferred all Trips logic from Dashboard to Trips component

    Next: 
        Figure out how to click on a trip and pull up an event with all events in the trip
            (fetch request with a query that pulls up this info)
        Create an event component that shows all of the info for the event
        Create inputs with CRUD
            Dashboard:
                âœ… Get all trips (...limit up to 5)
                ğŸ˜¡ Create a new trip
            
            Trips Component:
                ğŸ˜¡ Create a new trip
                ğŸ˜¡ Update Trip
                ğŸ˜¡ Delete Trip

            Events Component:
            (For each individual trip -- be able to):
                ğŸ˜¡ Get all events
                ğŸ˜¡ Create a new event
                ğŸ˜¡ Update event
                ğŸ˜¡ Delete events
